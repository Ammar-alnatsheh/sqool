# An Introduction to SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for working with relational data. Relational data is stored within Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, sqlite DB2 and more. Each of these RDBMS have their own unique spin on SQL syntax, so in your progression learning the language, you will always need to keep an eye out for minor syntax changes depending on which RDBMS you are using.

Assuming you are working on a JavaScript based tech stack, you will probably not be doing a lot of writing raw SQL and/or interacting directly with some RDBMS. At the least you will be using already existing JavaScript libraries that allow you to write SQL statements inside your JavaScript, and most often you will use an ORM technology like Sequelize, which will provide you with a syntax for interacting with an RDBMS that looks and feels much more like JavaScript than SQL.

All that said, it is important you have some small amount of exposure and experience with raw SQL, and this short series of exercises will expose you to some of the basics of writing raw SQL.
